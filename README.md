The expense tracker tracks income and expenses. I built the expense tracker to record each transaction and to put each transaction into a category. The expense tracker shows a health overview. The expense tracker lets me sort expenses look at spending habits and create reports that show where money goes. I used programming tools to make the expense tracker. The expense tracker lets the user enter expenses assign a category to each expense and produce summaries of activity.

Matplotlib shows the pattern of my spending as the months go by.
