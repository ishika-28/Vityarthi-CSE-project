## Problem Statement
Everyday financial management can be confusing as well as problematic when transactions are built up, whether you are a student, parents, or working adults. People are struggling remember every expense, which hurts because they could not stick to their budget. This project aims to solve their problems by keeping their all expenses neatly and organised in a single application, by removing guesswork.
## Scope of the Project
Building a command line Expense Tracker for use. The Expense Tracker uses Python, Pandas and Matplotlib. The scope of the Expense Tracker includes:
1. Inputting expense records with date, category, and amount.
2. Categorizing expenses for systematic tracking.
3. Summerizing expenses to show total, average, maximum, and minimum values.
4. Visualizing expense data through graphical reports (bar charts).
5. Limitation: The application is built for use. The application only tracks sessions. The application does not use a database.
## Target Users
The application is for the user:
1. Students
2. Working professionals
3. Homemakers
